# ChaosChain

The future of governance is a computational arms race. ChaosChain builds the infrastructure, agents, and ecosystem that will define the rules of this new game.

## Overview

ChaosChain is a pioneering project exploring the intersection of blockchain governance, AI agents, and computational competition. The core thesis posits that governance is evolving into a competition determined primarily by computational resources, where AI agents with sufficient compute power will increasingly shape the future of blockchain systems and other coordination mechanisms.

### Core Concepts

- **Compute Governance Thesis**: Governance is becoming a computational arms race where decision optimization, narrative control, and solution space exploration are directly tied to computational resources.
- **Self-Evolving Chain**: A blockchain infrastructure designed to evolve through agent competition and collaboration.
- **Agent Ecosystem**: A diverse collection of AI systems that participate in governance, compete for influence, and collaborate to evolve blockchain protocols.

## Project Structure

This repository contains the documentation for the ChaosChain project, built using [Vocs](https://vocs.dev).

### Key Components

- `docs/`: Documentation files and website components
- `mermaid-diagrams/`: Diagrams illustrating project concepts 
- `compile-mermaid.js` & `watch-mermaid.js`: Scripts for generating and updating diagrams
- `vocs.config.ts`: Configuration for the documentation website

## Installation

To set up the development environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/chaoschain/chaoschain-lite-paper.git
cd chaoschain-lite-paper

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Usage

### Development

To start the development server with automatic diagram updates:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will:
- Start the Vocs development server
- Watch for changes in Mermaid diagrams and automatically compile them

### Building for Production

To build the documentation site for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Preview Production Build

To preview the production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

This project is an open invitation to everyone who wants to help shape the future of governance. We believe that as computational power becomes increasingly central to decision-making, it's crucial that we come together as a community to thoughtfully define and build the governance systems we want to see. Whether you're a developer, researcher, or someone passionate about the future of collective decision-making, your voice and contributions can help ensure this technological evolution serves humanity's best interests.

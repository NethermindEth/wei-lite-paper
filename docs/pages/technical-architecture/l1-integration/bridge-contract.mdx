# Chain Bridge Contract

import { MermaidDiagram } from '../../../components/MermaidDiagram';

## Overview

The Chain Bridge Contract facilitates secure asset transfers and communication between Layer 1 blockchains and ChaosChain networks. Each ChaosChain instance has a dedicated bridge contract that is automatically deployed by the Chain Registry Contract during chain registration, with initial funding allocated from the registration fee.

## Purpose and Functionality

The Chain Bridge Contract serves as the primary interface for:

1. **Asset Transfers** - Enables secure transfer of assets between L1 and ChaosChain networks
2. **Incentive Funding** - Provides a mechanism for seeding incentives to new chains
3. **State Anchoring** - Allows chains to anchor their state to L1 for additional security
4. **Cross-Chain Communication** - Enables cross-chain message passing validated by the ChaosChain network
5. **Validator Set Management** - Maintains an up-to-date validator set that mirrors the ChaosChain network

## Deployment and Funding

The Bridge Contract has a unique deployment model:

1. **Automatic Deployment** - Created by the Chain Registry Contract during chain registration
2. **Initial Funding** - Receives a percentage of the chain registration fee as initial capital
3. **Chain-Specific** - Each bridge is uniquely tied to a specific ChaosChain network
4. **Validator-Controlled** - Governed by the validator set of its associated chain

## Key Components

### Multi-signature Validation

All critical operations on the bridge contract require multi-signature validation from the validator set:

1. **Signature Collection**
   - ChaosChain validators sign operations off-chain
   - Signatures are collected until a threshold is reached (typically ≥ 2/3 of voting power)

2. **Signature Verification**
   - The contract verifies signature validity against the current validator set
   - Each validator's vote is weighted by their voting power
   - Operations only proceed if the threshold is met

3. **Replay Protection**
   - Unique nonces prevent signature reuse
   - Timestamps enforce time-bounded validity

### Asset Custody

The bridge contract securely custodies assets during cross-chain transfers:

1. **Deposit Processing**
   - Users deposit assets to the bridge contract on the L1 chain
   - Deposit events are monitored by ChaosChain validators
   - Corresponding assets are minted or released on the ChaosChain network

2. **Withdrawal Authorization**
   - ChaosChain validators authorize withdrawals via multi-signatures
   - Threshold signature validation ensures only legitimate withdrawals proceed
   - Asset release on L1 occurs only after validation

3. **Safety Mechanisms**
   - Withdrawal limits prevent excessive outflows
   - Delayed withdrawals provide time for emergency response
   - Circuit breakers can pause operations in case of detected attacks

### Validator Set Management

The validator set on the bridge contract must stay synchronized with the ChaosChain network:

1. **Initial Set**
   - The bridge is initialized with the genesis validator set during deployment
   - This set is provided by the Chain Registry during chain registration

2. **Set Updates**
   - The validator set can be updated with signatures from the current validators
   - Updates are initiated when validator changes occur on the ChaosChain
   - A threshold of signatures from the current set is required

3. **Security Considerations**
   - Gradual transitions prevent sudden control changes
   - Historical validators can be retained for a cool-down period
   - Validator changes are logged for auditing

## State Anchoring

The bridge contract allows the ChaosChain to periodically anchor its state to the L1 blockchain:

1. **Mechanism**
   - Validators submit the state root of a ChaosChain block along with signatures
   - The bridge contract verifies signatures and records the state root
   - This creates a cryptographic proof of the chain's state at a point in time

2. **Use Cases**
   - Provides additional security by leveraging L1 security properties
   - Enables external verification of chain states
   - Facilitates cross-chain interoperability
   - Helps resolve disputes in exceptional circumstances

3. **Efficiency Considerations**
   - State anchoring is periodic rather than continuous to minimize costs
   - Critical states (e.g., major protocol updates) are prioritized
   - Compressed or aggregated proofs reduce gas costs

## Integration with ChaosChain

The bridge contract works in tight coordination with the ChaosChain network:

1. **Chain Initialization**
   - The bridge is deployed with the initial validator set during chain registration
   - Initial funding from the registration fee seeds the bridge's operations

2. **Operational Integration**
   - Validator agents monitor the bridge for deposit events
   - The ChaosChain consensus validates and processes cross-chain events
   - Validator signatures are collected for withdrawal authorizations

3. **Administrative Controls**
   - Emergency pause capability for security incidents
   - Validator-controlled parameter adjustments
   - Upgrade paths for contract improvements

## Security Considerations

The bridge contract implements several security measures:

1. **Threshold Cryptography**
   - Multi-signature validation with voting power weighting
   - Dynamic thresholds based on operation sensitivity
   - Signature aggregation for gas efficiency

2. **Asset Protection**
   - Withdrawal limits and rate limiting
   - Delayed large withdrawals with notification period
   - Emergency pause capability for security incidents

3. **Validator Security**
   - Stake-weighted voting prevents small validator takeovers
   - Gradual validator set transitions
   - Monitoring for validator misbehavior

4. **Economic Safeguards**
   - Initial funding from registration fees
   - Fee structures to prevent spam attacks
   - Economic incentives aligned with security goals

## Integration Examples

### Depositing Assets to a Chain

```typescript
// Get bridge contract address from registry
const chainInfo = await registryContract.resolveChainByHumanId("cc-finance-derivatives-mainnet");
const bridgeContract = new ethers.Contract(chainInfo.bridgeContract, IChaosChainBridge.abi, wallet);

// Deposit ETH
const tx = await bridgeContract.depositETH(
  chainInfo.genesisHash,
  { value: ethers.utils.parseEther("1.0") }
);

const receipt = await tx.wait();
console.log(`ETH deposited with ID: ${receipt.events[0].args.depositId}`);

// Monitor ChaosChain for corresponding credit of funds
```

### Authorizing a Withdrawal

```typescript
// Validator-side code to sign withdrawal
async function signWithdrawal(withdrawalData) {
  const messageHash = ethers.utils.solidityKeccak256(
    ["address", "uint256", "bytes32", "uint256"],
    [withdrawalData.to, withdrawalData.amount, withdrawalData.withdrawalId, withdrawalData.nonce]
  );
  
  return await validatorWallet.signMessage(ethers.utils.arrayify(messageHash));
}

// Collect signatures from validators (≥ 2/3 of voting power)
const signatures = await collectValidatorSignatures(withdrawalData);

// Execute withdrawal with collected signatures
const tx = await bridgeContract.withdrawETH(
  withdrawalData.to,
  withdrawalData.amount,
  withdrawalData.withdrawalId,
  signatures
);

const receipt = await tx.wait();
console.log(`ETH withdrawn at transaction: ${receipt.transactionHash}`);
```

### Updating Validator Set

```typescript
// Prepare new validator set
const newValidators = [
  "0xabc123...",
  "0xdef456...",
  "0xghi789..."
];
const newVotingPowers = [40, 30, 30];

// Collect signatures from current validators (>2/3 of voting power required)
const signatures = await collectValidatorSignatures({
  type: "VALIDATOR_UPDATE",
  validators: newValidators,
  votingPowers: newVotingPowers,
  nonce: currentNonce
});

// Update validator set
const tx = await bridgeContract.updateValidatorSet(
  newValidators,
  newVotingPowers,
  signatures
);

const receipt = await tx.wait();
console.log(`Validator set updated at block ${receipt.blockNumber}`);
```
